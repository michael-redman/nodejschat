Install Linux archive dependencies:

#Debian
apt-get install nodejs npm

#CentOS
yum install nodejs npm

On whatever host will be your database server, also "apt-get install postgresql" or "yum install postgresql-server".


Install node dependencies:

#in this dir (same dir as package.json)
npm install


Configuration:

Create a database and import the schema and stored procedure with "cat schema.psql new_message.plpgsql | psql yourdatabasename". See the postgresql documentation for creating database users and databases.

Edit ws_server/site_conf.js, and optionally html/site_conf.js if you are going to use the example HTML client, to match your settings.


Launching (on Debian the node.js executable name is "nodejs" instead of "node"):

Run websocket server (uses settings in ws_server/site_conf.js):

node cluster.js ws_server/server.js

Optionally, run HTTP server for HTML+javascript client (uses settings in html/site_conf.js):

node cluster.js html/server.js


User sessions:

It is the embedding application's responsibility to create a valid session key in the database table "sessions". Else the websocket server will reject connection. The fields are session_key (text), user_name (text), chat_room (integer).

Example SQL: insert into sessions values('1','Michael Redman',0);

Use SSL and use session keys that are cryptographically hard to guess, otherwise you will have no security whatsoever.


Connecting:

Example connect with command line test client (ws server on port 56412)

node test_client.js 1 wss://yourhost.com:56412/ 2 10

Note ":56412/" not ":56412". Else you will not connect.

This command says make 1 socket connection to the server at the specified URL and port, using the session key value "2", and each client socket (in this case one) should "say something" on the average once every 10 seconds.

Example URL for HTML client in browser:

https://yourhost.com:56411/chat?session_key=1
